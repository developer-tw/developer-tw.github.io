# Follow Me If You Love Sports And Hiking

I am a software development engineer with nearly 20 years of experience in the mobile communication and application development field. In my free time, I love hiking and running, and I often purchase related products to use. I enjoy recommending products that I find useful and reasonably priced to everyone. Additionally, my friends run an e-commerce platform specializing in skincare products. If I come across any products that I find effective, I will also share them on this website. I hope you all will find them enjoyable.
